                <p>
                    I live in Omaha with my daughter, Lily, and my dog, Minnie. I 
                    love to read, re-watch episodes of Scrubs and The Simpsons, attend concerts, 
                    and try new restaurants. Before becoming a teacher, I worked for many 
                    years as a claims examiner. I began teaching for Omaha Public Schools in 2017 
                    and have been teaching for almost 5 years.

            <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>
                    Before deciding to become an educator, I attended Metropolitan Community College, where I earned an Associate 
                    of Arts degree in Liberal arts. I then transferred to Creighton University where 
                    I earned a Bachelor of Arts in English. Just a few months after finishing my 
                    bachelor's degree, I decided I wanted to teach, so I attended College 
                    of Saint Mary, where I earned a Master of Arts in Teaching. Most recently, I 
                    earned a Master of Science in Special Education at the University of Nebraska Omaha.

            <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
                <p>
                    I believe that all students should have equitable learning opportunities and 
                    a safe learning environment. As an educator, I work to meet students' unique 
                    learning needs and provide them with the tools they need to be successful 
                    students. Relationships come first, and I believe that students learn best when 
                    they trust their teacher. Finally, I believe that partnering with families helps 
                    foster students' learning and provides them with a strong support system as they 
                    navigate their education.
