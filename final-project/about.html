        <h3>Bio <img src="images/72CF22C9-439E-45EA-9216-7C01DDADB7B7_1_105_c.jpeg" alt="Woman and a child"></h3>
        <p>
            I live in Omaha with my daughter, Lily, and my dog, Minnie. I 
            love to read, re-watch episodes of Scrubs and The Simpsons, attend concerts, 
            and try new restaurants. Before becoming a teacher, I worked for many 
            years as a claims examiner. I began teaching for Omaha Public Schools in 2017 
            and have been teaching for almost 5 years.
        </p>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
            Before deciding to become an educator, I attended Metropolitan Community College, where I earned an Associate 
            of Arts degree in Liberal arts. I then transferred to Creighton University where 
            I earned a Bachelor of Arts in English. Just a few months after finishing my 
            bachelor's degree, I decided I wanted to teach, so I attended College 
            of Saint Mary, where I earned a Master of Arts in Teaching. Most recently, I 
            earned a Master of Science in Special Education at the University of Nebraska Omaha.
        </p>
        <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
            I believe that all students should have equitable learning opportunities and 
            a safe learning environment. As an educator, I work to meet students' unique 
            learning needs and provide them with the tools they need to be successful 
            students. Relationships come first, and I believe that students learn best when 
            they trust their teacher. Finally, I believe that partnering with families helps 
            foster students' learning and provides them with a strong support system as they 
            navigate their education.
