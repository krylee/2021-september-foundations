                    <h3>Bio</h3>
                    <p>
                        I live in Omaha with my daughter, Lily, and my dog, Minnie. I 
                        love to read, re-watch episodes of Scrubs and The Simpsons, attend concerts, 
                        and try new restaurants. Before becoming a teacher, I worked for many 
                        years as a claims examiner. I began teaching for Omaha Public Schools in 2017 
                        and have been teaching for almost 5 years.

                    <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
                        <p>
                            I believe that all students should have equitable learning opportunities and 
                            a safe learning environment. As an educator, I work to meet students' unique 
                            learning needs and provide them with the tools they need to be successful 
                            students. Relationships come first, and I believe that students learn best when 
                            they trust their teacher. Finally, I believe that partnering with families helps 
                            foster students' learning and provides them with a strong support system as they 
                            navigate their education.
