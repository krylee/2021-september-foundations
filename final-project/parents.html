    <h3>Curriculum</h3>
    <p>
        Our curriculum is designed to meet the <a
            href="https://cdn.education.ne.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2021-6-12-ELA-Standards-Horizontal.pdf" target="_blank">Nebraska
            English Language Arts Standards</a> and to prepare students for success on the ACT exam and in post-secondary
        education. The district has selected <a href="https://www.hmhco.com/programs/collections#overview" target="_blank">HMH
            Collections</a> textbooks for secondary English Language Arts students. These textbooks include selections from
        seminal government documents, fiction, poetry, and primary sources. Students will also read selected novels
        throughout the school year as they align with Collections units. Students who need additional support in reading
        comprehension skills will receive instruction using <a href="https://www.hmhco.com/products/system-44" target="_blank">HMH System
            44</a> and <a href="https://www.hmhco.com/programs/read-180-universal#overview" target="_blank">Read 180</a>. Both programs
        adjust for individual reading levels and to meet each student's unique needs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Students in our program also receive instruction in social and emotional skills in our Affective Skills class.
        During this class, students will have the opportunity to build set goals, complete self-assessments, engage in
        team-building, and practice mindfulness. This class is designed to help students learn to manage their emotions and
        utilize coping skills to advocate for their needs in school and the workplace.
