    <h3>Curriculum</h3>
    <p>
        Our district has adopted HMH Collections textbooks as our primary English 
        Language Arts curriculum. Collections contains a balanced combination of 
        short stories, poetry, drama selections, nonfiction essays, and primary source 
        documents. These selections allow students to learn the essential skills outlined 
        in the Nebraska State English Language Arts Standards. They also prepare 
        students for standardized assessments, such as the ACT, which is required for 
        all eleventh grade students in the state of Nebraska.
    </p>

    <h3>Grading Policies</h3>
    <p>
        Our school district has adopted standards-based grading, meaning that students 
        receive grades based on their ability to meet curriculum standards rather than 
        percentages. Standards-based grading measures proficiency in using specific 
        academic skills.
